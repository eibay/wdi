Would one be able to make an ajax call to this API? Why or why not?
Yes, because returns JSON

Make an HTTParty call to /joke in pry.Is this an ajax call? What's the difference between this and what you saw in the browser?

Not an AJAX call

Create an index.html with just html and body tags.

How would you go about viewing this html in the browser? Is your method using a server?
