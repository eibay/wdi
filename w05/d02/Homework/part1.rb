require 'prime'

 Prime.each(100) do |prime|
 	puts prime # Ret =>[2,3,5,7,11, ..., 97]
 end





# **Part 1**:
# **Write a command line app that prints prime numbers**
# - Print the prime numbers between 1-100
# - Do not just copy and paste these numbers, you should programmatically determine which numbers are prime
# - Your program should run once and then exit
# - Here is a snippet of sample output:
# ```
# 2
# 3
# 5
# 7
# 9
# 11
# 13
# ...
# ```
