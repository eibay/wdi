What is the difference between a GET and a POST request?
A GET request retrieves data from a specificed resource and displays the information in a query string in the URL. 

A POST request submits data to be processed. The information from the query string is sent in the request body, rather than the URL. 

The main difference between the two is that a POST request changes information on the server and the GET request does not.
