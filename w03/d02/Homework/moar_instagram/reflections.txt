Things I could do to make the Instagram tag search better

-make it so the page only refreshes when you save an image or tag.

-add a "save search" button so the whole page with all the images gets saved

-better organize all the html files

-remove the button html from the list items and make it two files: one for enabled and one for already saved

-improve the server log
