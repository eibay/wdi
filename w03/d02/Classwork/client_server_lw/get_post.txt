-- What is the difference between a GET and a POST request?

A GET request sends a request to the server. The full request (query parameters) is contained in the URL. GET request doesn't change information.

A POST sends information to the server. The parameters of the request are in the body of the header. POST request changes information.

-- When to use GET

Use GET when the client is requesting a page or information from the server.

-- When to use POST

Use when security is a concern since information won't be in the URL and hence won't be visible or saved in the browser history. 

Use to provide information (such as from forms) that the server will subsequently store.
