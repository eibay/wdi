what is the difference between a GET request and a POST request

POST requests are never cached
POST requests do not remain in the browser history
POST requests cannot be bookmarked
POST requests have no restrictions on data length
POST requests data is not displayed in the URL

GET requests can be cached
GET requests remain in the browser history
GET requests can be bookmarked
GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
GET requests have length restrictions
GET requests should be used only to retrieve data
GET requests data is visible to everyone in the URL
GET is less secure compared to POST because data sent is part of the URL
