Difference between GET and POST:

For a GET request parameters are stored in the URL

For POST parameters are not stored in the browser history.

A GET request can be bookmarked.

A POST request can be bookmarked.

For a GET request, requests are re-executed but may not be resubmitted to the server.

For a POST request, the data will need to be resubmitted.

GET is less secure, data is sent as part of the URL.

POST is more secure because data is not stored in the cache.

GET request = Wikipedia search

POST request = Logging in to my bank account site
