Part 2: Fun with tables

GOAL: Practice creating and querying tables with a SQL database
SPEC:
Create a file called outputs.txt. Throughout this homework you will be copying output from your terminal after running a specific command and pasting it into this outputs.txt.

Create a database called tablefun
Create the following tables in that database with the specified fields
Schools Table:
Create a table called schools
Add the fields name, city, and state. Each being of type varchar
Add the field zip as a varchar of 5 characters
Add 3 schools with different data into the table

Select all schools and copy and paste the output in the terminal to outputs.txt
JillOrtenberg=# SELECT * FROM schools;
 id |         name          |       city       |  state   |  zip
----+-----------------------+------------------+----------+-------
  1 | South Side HS         | Rockville Centre | New York | 11570
  2 | Oceanside HS          | Oceanside        | New York | 11480
  3 | University of Arizona | Tucson           | Arizona  | 14383
(3 rows)

Show the structure of the table by typing \d schools and copy and paste this output into outputs.txt
JillOrtenberg=# \d schools
                                Table "public.schools"
 Column |         Type          |                      Modifiers
--------+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------------
 id     | integer               | not null default nextval('schools_id_seq'::regclass)
 name   | character varying(50) |
 city   | character varying(50) |
 state  | character varying(30) |
 zip    | character varying(5)  |
Indexes:
    "schools_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)

Bonus change every school's name to "Manhattan High". Select all schools again and copy and paste this output into outputs.txt
JillOrtenberg=# UPDATE schools SET name='Manhattan High';
UPDATE 3
JillOrtenberg=#


Teachers Table:
Create a table called teachers
Add the fields name, email, and subject. Each being of type varchar
Add the field age as an integer
Add 2 teachers with the subject math and 4 teachers in various other subjects
Select all teachers and copy and paste the output in the terminal to outputs.txt
JillOrtenberg=# SELECT * FROM teachers;
 id |        name        |            email            |   subject    | age
----+--------------------+-----------------------------+--------------+-----
  1 | Ms. Jane Smith     | jsmith@oceansidehs.com      | Math         |  30
  2 | Mr. Seymour Brown  | sbrown@southsidehs.com      | Math         |  35
  3 | Mr. John Miluf     | jmiluf@uofarizona.com       | Painting     |  38
  4 | Mr. Sam Williamson | swilliamson@oceansidehs.com | Physics      |  23
  5 | Ms. Jill Nelson    | jnelson@oceansidehs.com     | Gym          |  40
  6 | Ms. Amy Smith      | asmith@uorarizona.com       | Anthropology |  51
(6 rows)

Show the structure of the table by typing \d teachers and copy and paste this output into outputs.txt
JillOrtenberg=# \d teachers
                                 Table "public.teachers"
 Column  |         Type          |                       Modifiers
---------+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------
 id      | integer               | not null default nextval('teachers_id_seq'::regclass)
 name    | character varying(50) |
 email   | character varying(40) |
 subject | character varying(50) |
 age     | integer               |
Indexes:
    "teachers_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)

Bonus update every math teacher to be 40 years old. Put the SQL statement you used into your outputs.txt
JillOrtenberg=# UPDATE teachers SET age=40 WHERE subject='Math';
UPDATE 2
JillOrtenberg=#
Bonus delete all math teachers. Copy and paste the SQL statement you used into outputs.txt
