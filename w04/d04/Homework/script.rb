File.write "What is a DATABASE?\nA database is a program, designed to keep records.\nWhat is problematic about using files instead of a db?\nReliability & having been thought through by computer scientists.\n\nClayton, you know what a SCHEMA is, right? Because you totally heard *ev-er-y-thing* Neel said in lecture today, right? And you weren't mucking about on Hipchat at all, right?\nI am not sure I do know. But the [simple Wikipedia article for Database schema][simple] makes me think what we do when we issue the commands to create a db & create tables inside the db is describing to `psql` the schema, the schematic, the blueprint, whatever that is.\n\n[simple]: http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema \"Database schema on Wikipedia\"\n\nIf a user or process is not adding/deleting/querying the db, is the db process still running?\nYes, it is listening on a port for queries.\n"
