Create a file called writeup.txt to record your answers to the following questions:
		In your own words: what is a database?
		List some problems with using files instead of a database
		What is a schema (google may confuse you here)
		When you are not specifically adding/deleting or querying your database, is it still running?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.	A database is a collection of tables that may be relatable.

2		Some problems using .txt files to store data instead of a database:
		
			a.	datatype may be inconsistant
			b.	very easy to make an error on it (i.e. missed comma, quotes)
			c.	the keys to the data are not enforceable.

3.	Schema - basically a template for a hash.

4.	Database is a program. If you haven't quit out of it, it is still running.
