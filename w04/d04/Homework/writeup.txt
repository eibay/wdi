1.  A database is a system.  It's generated by a program.  It's purpose is to organize according to the rules the user creates.

2.  A file is inferior because it's easy for us to create errors in them that can break our code.  There's also no enforcement of our rules and needs- I can very easily create an entry in my file with six attributes when my class, for example, typically has eight.

3.  That, if I'm not mistaken, refers to those rules and requirements we set.  If we say our content must be entered thus and so, we are defining schema.

6.  I think I've got this: yes.  It's listening on a port.  It's somewhat like a serveer in that way.
