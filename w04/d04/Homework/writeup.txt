--> A database is a well-structured and organized compilation of data, which can benreadily updated and extracted.

--> Files are easy to break, there is no set schema, and the data cannot be easily obtained.

--> A schema is sort of like a data structure template that prevents a user from breaking their tables and databases.

--> Yes, the database is always running, but whether a user is connected or not is the question.

--> An id is not needed for either table, because SQL autmatically assigns the id's, and also manages the instance where an id is deleted and a new entry is created.
