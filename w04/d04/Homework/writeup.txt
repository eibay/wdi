-- In your own words: what is a database?

A database is a collection of data, organized in tables.

-- List some problems with using files instead of a database

* hard to read and edit
* prone to error when editing
* anything can go into them willy-nilly, regardless of the desired structure of the data
* possible unwieldy to navigate and manipulate

-- What is a schema (google may confuse you here)

A schema is a template for data--a plan and structure as to its organization

-- When you are not specifically adding/deleting or querying your database, is it still running?

I would think it is running as long as you're connected to it, but maybe not. Maybe since it's a way of storing data, it just sits around waiting for orders. In that sense, maybe Postgres is running, but the database is passive.
