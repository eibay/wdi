In your own words: what is a database?
List some problems with using files instead of a database
What is a schema (google may confuse you here)
When you are not specifically adding/deleting or querying your database, is it still running?

A database is a particular system of storage. 

A database will allow you to maitain consistent data. 

A schema defines the way your data is stored.

I think so.
