##Questions 

__What is a DATABASE?__ 

A database is a program, designed to keep records.

__What is problematic about using files instead of a db?__ 

Reliability & having been thought through by computer scientists.

__Clayton, you know what a SCHEMA is, right? Because you totally heard *ev-er-y-thing* Neel said in lecture today, right? And you weren't mucking about on Hipchat at all, right?__ 

I am not sure I do know. But the [simple Wikipedia article for Database schema][simple] makes me think what we do when we issue the commands to create a db & create tables inside the db is describing to `psql` the schema, the schematic, the blueprint, whatever that is.

[simple]: http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema "Database schema on Wikipedia"

__If a user or process is not adding/deleting/querying the db, is the db process still running?__ 

Yes, it is listening on a port for queries.
