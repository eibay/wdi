what is a database?

Databases give our data consistency and structure. It is just a program running on our computer.

List some problems with using files instead of a database

Text files are easy to screw up, they dont enforce schema or keys and allow for data type inconsistency.

What is a schema?

A schema is a template for the hash. For example, I want my house hash to have a name and an age.

When you are not specifically adding/deleting or querying your database, is it still running?

i assume so... so that the information can be accessed always even if you are not changing anything.
