Create a file called writeup.txt to record your answers to the following questions:
In your own words: what is a database?
List some problems with using files instead of a database
What is a schema (google may confuse you here)
When you are not specifically adding/deleting or querying your database, is it still running?

1. A database is a program that runs on your computer and retains your data on a server. A database organizes your
data and keep track of it with primary serial keys. 
2. Files can easily be broken if edited. Files are difficult to edit and search. 
3. A schema is a tree diagram that displays in your terminal that shows you the current structure of your
database or drive.
4. Yes as long as you have your database running in your terminal you do not specifically have to query or add/delete to make it run.
