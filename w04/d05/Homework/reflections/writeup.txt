Compare and contrast the Model class we have been using to ActiveRecord
What is ActiveRecord doing? How does it relate to our database server?

Like the Model class, we can use the ActiveRecord class to inherit its built in methods which will allow us access our database. In ActiveRecord, however, we will have a orginizational method similar to what we practiced with psql. 

ActiveRecord is helping us create, organize, and retreive our data.

Which component receives and interprets SQL statements? Which component connects to the postgresql database server? What kind of data (string, integer, other...) does it send and receive?
