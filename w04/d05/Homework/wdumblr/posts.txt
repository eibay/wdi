[{"content":"A melon purchase is a commitment in a way that buying an apple, say, is not. A mealy apple can be philosophically tossed, but a mealy watermelon is a sloppy, head-shaking disposal project.</p><p>Summer is the season to practice melon-picking skills, since your risk of getting a total dud is low. Even so, shipments vary in quality, so the first thing to do is scan the melons to see if they look like a good batch. Even the best of a green or overripe batch is probably marginal, so you’ll want to find a good group first and then pick the best of the bunch.</p><p>Conventional melon wisdom – buy a heavy, hollow-sounding one – never helps me. Maybe I have a bad ear, but watermelon-thumping leaves me confused. And melons all seem pretty heavy, so gauging relative weight never gives me confidence either. I rely on visual clues for watermelons and a mix of look and scent for thinner-skinned melons like honeydew and cantaloupe.","created_at":"10:00 August 29, 2014","keyword":"melon","author_id":"2984d5981c82538180b5fade0bd991f2","id":"82c896bf221c9f83ecebc30fb43b14fd"},{"content":"I love nachos. I love California rolls. Of course I LOVE California roll nachos. Sure, they’re essentially the illegitimate child of Japanese and Mexican cuisine, but considering the fact that California rolls are by no means traditional Japanese food (same with nachos and Mexican food), then it was inevitable that they would come together in a glorious delicious pile of flavours covered in melted cheese.","created_at":" 1:18 August 29, 2014","keyword":"nachos","author_id":"9bb4b05dca052f7a5434483701274f75","id":"2a78908d89de7ebaf3290868a0a483dd"}]
