A) Draw a diagram of the following components and their interactions (as well as the protocols they use to interact):

DB server (postgresql)
server.rb
ActiveRecord
sintra
HTTParty (Instagram API)
Client's web browser
psql
Please take a photo of this diagram and put it in the reflection folder.



B) In reflection/writeup.txt please explain the distinction between:

Postgresql database server
As a database server, its primary function is to store data, securely and supporting best practices, and retrieve it later, as requested by other software applications

Wdumblr database
The database is the collection of posts, authors and images tables 

authors, posts, and images tables
stores the information of authors names and emails, posts information and image tables

psql
psql is a terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL. It enables you to type in queries interactively, issue them to PostgreSQL, and see the query results. Alternatively, input can be from a file. In addition, it provides a number of meta-commands and various shell-like features to facilitate writing scripts and automating a wide variety of tasks

ActiveRecord
 the active record pattern is an architectural pattern found in software that stores its data in relational databases

Which component receives and interprets SQL statements? Which component connects to the postgresql database server? What kind of data (string, integer, other...) does it send and receive?
