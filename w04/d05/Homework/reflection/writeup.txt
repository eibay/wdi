* The 'Model' class we have been using is very similar to ActiveRecord. Methods are named the same, data is written to a textfile named a pluralized version of the class.  However, ActiveRecord is much more versatile since it writes data to a database instead of a txt file, so that individual records are much more easily accessed and edited. I'm psyched to use ActiveRecord! 

* ActiveRecord is writing to a SQL database/table schema, so we can create a database server in postgres and access it with Ruby/ActiveRecord instead of through the terminal. 

* Postgresql is a database server that holds your databases. 

* Wdumbler database is a collection of tables we created to use with our blog server. 

* Authors, posts, and images tables hold information about the objects we create.

* psql is an interface with SQL. It connects to the postgresql database server. It sends strings and integers which are interpreted as many different predetermined data types by SQL. I think???

* ActiveRecord is a framework that connects ruby classes with SQL. It sends and interprets SQL statements.
