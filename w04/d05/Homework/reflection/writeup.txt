*Compare and contrast the Model class we have been using to ActiveRecord
--I think the schema/structure of the Model class is in line with the schema/structure of ActiveRecord. I am unclear about many of the specifics. 
1 specific thing,, I can designate a column in a table to be a foreign key and that Active Record will by default add an integer column for Primary Key "id".
2 specific thing, instances of the model/class are represented by table rows. The model/class is the table name. The columns are @attribute/instance variables.

Interesting tid bits I found...
The table containing the foreign key is called the referencing or child table, and the table containing the candidate key is called the referenced or parent table.[4]

Object-Relational Mapping, commonly referred to as its abbreviation ORM, is a technique that connects the rich objects of an application to tables in a relational database management system.

*What is ActiveRecord doing? How does it relate to our database server? 
It seems that chapter 5 of the documentation talks about syntax and code to actually implement Active Record on your server. And access the data in the data base.

I was unable to see what it does because after installing the gem and updating my console.rb file and running it with a binding.pry, I got this error message

$ ruby console.rb

Add `gem 'pg'` to your Gemfile (and ensure its version is at the minimum required by ActiveRecord). (Gem::LoadError)
