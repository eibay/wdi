#### Part 2 - Prediction

# 1) Given a name/domain name pair predict what their email address is based on the pattern that was found the most.
#   * If the most found pattern was `e` then ouput "Cannot predict."

# ```ruby
# ["PJ Hughes", "generalassemb.ly"]

# # Your code should output:

# puts ["pj.hughes@generalassembl.ly"]
# ```

# 2) Predict a batch of email addresses at once:

# ```ruby
# [
#   ["PJ Hughes", "generalassemb.ly"],
#   ["Eric Schmidt", "google.com"],
#   ["Kel Mitchell", "nickelodeon.com"]
# ]

# # Your code should output:
# puts [
#   "pj.hughes@generalassemb.ly",
#   "eric@google.com",
#   "kel.mitchell@nickelodeon.com",
# ]
# ```
