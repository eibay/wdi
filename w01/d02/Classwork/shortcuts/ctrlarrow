I wanted to learn some shortcuts to jump around the command line and found this article:

However I found that their suggestions to use ctrl + left or right arrows to jump between typed arguments was being overridden by my OS's dashboard settings. 

I found holding option instead of ctrl worked with arrow keys to move quickly between arguments in the command line. ctrl + letter shortcuts work as suggested.
