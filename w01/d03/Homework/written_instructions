each subway line is an array

you get the beginning line, beginning stop, ending line, ending stop as inputs

ending location minus beginning location will give you the distance travelled because of the indices associated with each element.

if there is an intersection at union square, then you have to do some math about calculating the two journeys and misusing the overlapped area. 

also, remember to do absolute value to account for both north-south and east-west directions
