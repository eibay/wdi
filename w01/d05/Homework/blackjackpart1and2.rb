# Part 1

# Create an array with all the cards in a deck (2-10, J, Q, K A)
# Don't explicitly just write out an array with 52 cards
# You can write out a smaller array and then generate the rest
# Output the array of cards

# Part 2

# Goal: To create a program that chooses two cards from the deck at random and outputs its value in blackjack.
# To calculate the value of a hand of cards:
# 2-10 have the value of their number
# All face cards have the value of 10
# Ace is 1
