#Week01-Day05: Friday Afternoon Lab

## Blackjack

###Part 1
#   - Create an array with all the cards in a deck (2-10, J, Q, K A)
#   - **Don't** explicitly just write out an array with 52 cards
#     - You can write out a smaller array and then generate the rest
#     - Output the array of cards
# ------

# ###Part 2
# - Goal: To create a program that chooses two cards from the deck *at random* and outputs its value in blackjack.
# - To calculate the value of a hand of cards:
#   - 2-10 have the value of their number
#   - All face cards have the value of 10
#   - Ace is 1

# -----

# ###Part 3
# - Goal: To create a program that chooses 3 cards *at random*,
# - Have it output the cards and their blackjack value or
#   - Also include whether that value is "bust".
# - Loop this program until there are no cards left in the deck.


# -----
# ###Part 4

# - Goal: Create one sided blackjack
#   - A user is given two cards at random
#   - They can type "Hit me" or "Stay"
#   - If they type "Hit me" then draw another card, if they have gone bust tell them. Then draw another hand, which will once again give them the options "Hit Me" or "Stay".
#   - If they choose "Stay" then output the Blackjack value of their hand. Then draw another hand, , which will once again give them the options "Hit Me" or "Stay".
# - The game should end when you run out of cards

# # When max is an Integer, rand returns a random integer greater than or equal to zero and less than max.
