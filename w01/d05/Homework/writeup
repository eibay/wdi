Free form reflect on the week; what did you realize? how did the material from the week inform or change what you thought about programming before you got here? what are you excited about? what are you confused about?
- I definitely realized that you need to get into a different state of mind when programming as it is a different way of thinking. Going through
the thought process and turning that into code can be a challenge, as there are many things to consider. One thing I would like to get better is 
planning my "plan of attack" before coding as opposed to just coding anything I think of as I try to think of the big picture
as opposed to taking it little by little.
