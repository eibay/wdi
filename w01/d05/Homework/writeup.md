##Week01-Day05

###Write-up
* Write up the following and save it as a textfile in your w01/d05/Homework folder:
  * What is an IP address?
  * What is a port?
  * How do IP addresses and ports help us to connect to other computers?
  * What data type is used for input/output?
  * How was it helpful to know what your partner's server could respond to?
  * Hypothetically, what would you have done if you didn't know (ie, planned it) what your partner's computer responded to?
  * Free form reflect on the week; what did you realize? how did the material from the week inform or change what you thought about programming before you got here? what are you excited about? what are you confused about?

  1) An IP address is simply the address for a website on the internet. It's a way for a browser to tell the server "Hey man, I would like to go to this site", and the server on which the website is hosted relays back a webpage to the browser by detemining which address/IP was asked for, as each IP has a unique set of numbers assigned to them. Protocols are bascially rules that govern which computer asks what and who goes first and coordinates the submission and results process by connecting one computer to another and thus one IP to another.

  2) If an IP address is an apt bldg, or our computer with many different individual parties. The different parties are different ports, which are the individual apartments within the bldg.
  No other program can use the same port, every program has its own port. There are many many ports. If its not running any other application then the port can be used to run xyz.

  3) A socket is the way we open up our computer and its programs to be able to talk to other computers and other programs.

  4)

  5) It was helpful to know what my partner's server responded to because it painted a picture as to how to go about creating a flow of back and forth between our computers and helped create a narrative.

  6) I would have tried to understand how I want the program to run and work on the algorithms before I actually started writing code.

  7) I realized that knowing syntax, basic debugging and the general knowledge of programming is only the beginning when it comes to diving into the vast world of computers and computer science. The implementation is far more important to understand, the logic behind how computers and programs run and do what they do in combination with the rules of programming is where the true mastery lies. I am excited because I can only improve from here since I am still very new and eager to learn this new art and skill, but I would be remiss if I didn't say that it is definitely very intense and confusing at times, a puzzle and a mystery. I would like to understand the way loops work better, I feel comfortable with git and the terminal.
