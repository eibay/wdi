1. An IP address is a unique number assigned to each computer and server(as well as other devices); this number tells servers and clients where to go to find requested data on a network.
2. A port is an entry way for data into a computer; each program is assigned a different (usually!) port number so that the program can receive the correct data from a network.
3. The IP address tells a program which computer to go to to get requested data, the port tells the program where on that particular computer to find the requested data. 
4. Strings.
5. That information can help you prepare for their response.
6. First, identify the incoming data structure. Next, analyze the data and compare it to data that I am looking to recieve.  If the data is similar to what I am looking for, see if the addition of the incoming data makes sense as an answer (i.e. is it a string of "yes" when I asked a yes or no question?  is it an array of "copper_pots", "whiskers_on_kittens", "big_butts" when I asked for someone's favorite things?). If available, I would also look into what caused the partner's computer to send such information.
7. The major thing I learned this week is that even though there is a seemingly insurmoutable amount of things to learn about coding, if you step back and build your knowledge base from the bottom up it's not daunting at all. Another big thing I took away was that no matter how much you know, there's always more to learn and discover, particularly when looking over other people's code.  Creating things has always been my passion (whether it's music, a new dish, or Halo maps) so I'm really excited to be able to come up with ideas and execute them in a new medium. While I'm not as much of a visual artist I am looking forward to having control over that aspect of the user experience.  So far the toughest part has been working with hashes and keeping track of overly nested elements, but I'm sure practice will help me get over those obstacles. Oh, and git.
