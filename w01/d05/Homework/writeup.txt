1. An IP address is a unique number assigned to every computer or device connected to the internet or connected to a network that's connected to the internet.

2. A port is to a computer like an apartment to an address.  Within each (occupied) apartment is a computer "listening", waiting for an incoming signal.

3. As they're unique, they allow us to find, with specificity, a particular computer or device.

4. Strings.

5. I knew that the program on the other computer was listening for certain prompts.  Without them, I'd get no response.

6. Hmmm I suppose I wouldn't know what to do without reading the code- I guess I could enter "help" and see what happened.

12. Learned a lot.  This Blackjack problem made me really plan everything out.  Planning without writing code is a powerful approach.  It's what I'll do if I ever get stuck, which happened this time.  Also, giving variables descriptive names is also something that I "learned" to do, in that if I hadn't, I might have gotten nowhere.  I also feel like there was something else valuable I wanted to note but I can't remember it.  I'll just leave that thought here so that I'm reminded to search for it, or welcome it should it appear.

Thanks guys!


I remembered what it is- reading the spec.  Reading it, and reading it again, so that you can fully absorb all the goals youneed to meet.
