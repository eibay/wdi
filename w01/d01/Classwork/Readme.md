##Two Car-related Scripts

`stoplight` imitates the behavior of a car running into a light. Just pass it
the color of the light.

For example: 

    $ stoplight green 

Eventually `stoplight`'s gastank will run out.

Refill it like this:

    $ stoplight -refill green

`go` imitates the behavior of a car w/ a GPS.

    $ go New York
    $ go Hong Kong

It will either take you where you want to go or seemingly flat-out refuse.
