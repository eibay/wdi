Pipe your javascripts straight into your browser.

Inspired by [bcat](https://github.com/kessler/node-bcat), except instead of
piping HTML or text into scat you just pipe JavaScript â€“ which will get wrapped
up with an `index.html` and boot up the page for you.

## Usage ##

[![scat](https://nodei.co/npm/scat.png?mini=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/scat)

Either point scat to a JavaScript file:

``` bash
scat bundle.js
```

Or pipe your JavaScript into it:

``` bash
browserify -d index.js | uglifyjs -cm | scat
```

In the interest of keeping things as simple as possible, there's no
command-line flags to use here for now. Enjoy!
