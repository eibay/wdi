##MVP

 1. There should be an textbox where the user can add a new todo item
  - place this wherever you feel is appropriate
  - pressing enter after entering text should add the todo item to the top/beginning of the todo list
 - All todos should be listed as `<li>`'s underneath a `<ul>` 
 - Each todo item should have a checkbox next to it that when clicked removes that todo item from the list
