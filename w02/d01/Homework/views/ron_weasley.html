Ronald Bilius "Ron" Weasley (b. 1 March, 1980) was a pure-blood wizard, the sixth son of Arthur Weasley and Molly Weasley (n√©e Prewett). He was also the younger brother of Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred and George, and the elder brother of Ginny. Ron and his brothers and sister lived in The Burrow where Harry and Hermione stayed quite often. Ron began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991 and was sorted into Gryffindor house. He soon became best friends with fellow student Harry Potter and later Hermione Granger.

Together, they faced many challenges during their adolescence, including keeping the Philosopher's Stone from Professor Quirinus Quirrell, saving Ron's sister from the Chamber of Secrets, forming Dumbledore's Army, and fighting in numerous battles of the Second Wizarding War, including the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts. Ron also became a Gryffindor prefect and a Keeper on the Gryffindor Quidditch team during his fifth year at Hogwarts. He skipped his last year of school in order to accompany Harry and Hermione on a quest to destroy the Horcruxes of Lord Voldemort and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998, in which he lost his brother, Fred, a loss which devastated him and his family.

After the war, Ron, along with Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom, joined the Aurors at the invitation of Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt, in order to track down Death Eaters who escaped capture.[15] Eventually, he went to work at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes with his brother George.[16] He and Hermione eventually married and had two children: a daughter named Rose and a son named Hugo. Ron was also the godfather to James Sirius Potter, his sister Ginny Weasley and Harry Potter's eldest child.
