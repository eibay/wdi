	<p>I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left â€” Bill was Head Boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first.</p>
