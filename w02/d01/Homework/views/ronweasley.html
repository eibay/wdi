	<p>Ronald Bilius "Ron" Weasley (b. 1 March, 1980) was a pure-blood wizard, the sixth son of Arthur Weasley and Molly Weasley (n√©e Prewett). He was also the younger brother of Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred and George, and the elder brother of Ginny. Ron and his brothers and sister lived in The Burrow where Harry and Hermione stayed quite often. Ron began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991 and was sorted into Gryffindor house. He soon became best friends with fellow student Harry Potter and later Hermione Granger.
