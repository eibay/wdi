<br>
Harry James Potter (b. 31 July, 1980) was a half-blood wizard, the only child and son of James and Lily Potter (n√©e Evans), and one of the most famous wizards of modern times. In what proved to be a vain attempt to circumvent a prophecy, that stated a boy born at the end of July of 1980 could be able to defeat him, Lord Voldemort attempted to murder him when he was a year and three months old, shortly after murdering Harry's parents as they tried to protect him.
