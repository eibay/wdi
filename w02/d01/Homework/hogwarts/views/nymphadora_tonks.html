Nymphadora Lupin (née Tonks) (c. 1973 – 2 May, 1998), more commonly known as Tonks, was a half-blood witch and the only child of Ted and Andromeda Tonks (née Black). She was a Metamorphmagus and attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1984 to 1991. She was sorted into Hufflepuff House and was in the same year at Hogwarts as Gryffindor Charlie Weasley.

After leaving Hogwarts, Tonks joined the Ministry of Magic and trained to become an Auror under the watchful eye of Alastor Moody, qualifying in 1994. In 1995, she joined the Second Order of the Phoenix, working undercover in the Ministry and helping to guard the Department of Mysteries. In June of 1996, she fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and at some point fell in love with Remus Lupin. Remus, a werewolf, felt he was too poor, old, and dangerous for her and thus rejected her feelings, although he felt the same way. In the wake of the return of Lord Voldemort, Tonks was assigned to Hogsmeade as part of the Auror task force sent to guard Hogwarts. Tonks later fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and, after seeing the love Fleur Delacour held for Bill Weasley despite his injuries, publicly declared her love for Remus.

Tonks and Remus were married in the summer of 1997. Tonks became pregnant shortly after, and Remus began to worry that he had passed on his werewolf condition to his son, though this proved not to be the case (Teddy inherited his mother's metamorphic abilities). Tonks gave birth to a son, Teddy Remus Lupin (named after her late father Edward Tonks), shortly after Easter in 1998 and named Harry Potter the godfather. On the 2 May of that same year, Tonks fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, and was murdered by her aunt, Bellatrix Lestrange, a Death Eater and a loyal and devoted servant of Lord Voldemort.
