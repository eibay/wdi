Seamus Finnigan (b. 1980) was a half-blood wizard, son of Mr Finnigan, who was a Muggle, and Mrs Finnigan, who was a witch, something that shocked Mr Finnigan when he first learned it. Seamus was a Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was also the best friend of Dean Thomas. Seamus originally doubted Harry Potter's claim that Lord Voldemort had returned in 1995, as his mother doubted it, too. However,  late in 1995 he eventually joined Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter, after apologising to Harry. In 1997, he continued his seventh year at Hogwarts, although the school was under the control of Voldemort. Seamus remained in the D.A. in his seventh year and fought bravely in the Battle of Hogwarts.
