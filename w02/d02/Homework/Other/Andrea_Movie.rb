# #### A movies index page
# `/movies`

# The page should show a list of all the movies in the db and list them as follows with the name of the title and a link:
# ```html
# <ol>
#   <li><a href="/movies/The%20Shawshank%20Redemption">The Shawshank Redemption</a></li>
#   <!-- and so on..-->
# </ol>
# #we do it like this so when we want 
# #to see if the name == the name in the hash, it will match


# #### A page for each movie
# Given:
# `/movies/The%20Dark%20Night`

# The page should show the title, rating, the year it was made, and a link to the imdb.
