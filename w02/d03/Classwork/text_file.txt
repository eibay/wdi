.gsubbing, G!

In Ruby, if you pull in html from an outside file, Ruby will not allow you to interpolate ruby objects into the html string

so you can use the .gsub method to make your html dynamic

.gsub finds the sequence within the imported html string, and substitutes it with the ruby element you desire (either a variable that you named earlier, or any string you desire)
	item = "this is a variable"
	html.gsub('{{item}}', item) 

Within the html file, you wrap the item you want to .gsub in {{}}, which makes it easier for the .gsub program to distinguish what you want replaced with other occurances of the buzzword.

You can .gsub multiple items in the html file by creating a chain 
	html.gsub('{{something}}', something).gsub('{{something_else}}', something_else)
