In todays assignment I realized that we are substituting HTML files into our ruby code while using variables to direct us to the html file. Using the gsub method we can go to another file in our computer and look at the string we want to subtitute in another file and put a method/action so that we can execute it in ruby. I found it extremely interesting that we are incorporating an html file into our ruby code.
