What you taught us yesterday and today helps me to understand how server side and client side are connecting each other. Now finally got the good point why I am learning Ruby. I think I covered 70% of what you taught. So far feeling confortable. I want you to teach what specific benefits are going to be received after learning these things.

Sorry for my poor English.
