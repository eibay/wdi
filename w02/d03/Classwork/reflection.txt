Some new concepts I learned and am still learning is using ruby to generate HTML files.
I have always used HTML in the past locally, having the server and ruby's power involved
makes the use of HTML more dynamic in my opinion.

Using {{}} to connect the HTML files to Ruby instead of the #{} style that is used for
string interpolation in Ruby.

Having HTML tags in a Ruby file, at first seemed really counterintuitive, because I saw tags
next to while loops and stuff, but eventually made sense.

Building a basic section of a web application.

Learning what and how we will be adding stuff to our views folder in our future awesome kick ass
Rails Applications.

Learn the structuring of what goes where better which for me is fundamental because if you don't know
how to arrange the data to be used later you cant use it.
