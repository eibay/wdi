I find that I learned how everything works together but it took a while for my brain to comprehend.  Also, still find it hard to know what belongs in html and which elements of html do you put straight into ruby example <li> is in our ruby file not html.  I understand the concept but I am still not 100%. As well, how do you know which method brings out a string from an array (.join) and .split makes an array etc.
