What have i just learned?

I learned how to create a dynamic webpages, aka, a page that i can always add new information to without repeating every step for each new piece of information. With .gsub i am able to change my html all i want but still maintain the structure of a dynamic website. This is valuable for websites with constantly refreshing information and websites with alot of date, or both.

html is at our command, and we are able to intersperse dynamic information and send to a client.
