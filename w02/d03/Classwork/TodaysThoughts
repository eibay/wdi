I faced the complexity of using a variety of applications in concert--each with their own capabilities and limitations--to achieve a goal. In the end, I just have to wrap my head around the snake-eating-his-tail feeling. In today's example, Ruby and HTML are feeding each other. Ruby is accepting HTML from the HTML file, processing and populating it, and then displaying it to the browser as HTML. (Until I wrote this, I thought it was handing it back to the HTML file, but no. It's a one-way street which I mistook for a two-way.)
