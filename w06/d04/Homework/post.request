Eric Kramer wrote some code describing how to accept post request to a server written in js. Jeff indicated this involves binary (hot damn!). 

    var body = "";

    req.on('data', function(chunk) {
        body += chunk;
    });

	req.on('end', function(){
	    console.log("POSTED: " + body);
	    res.end("ASDADS");
	});
